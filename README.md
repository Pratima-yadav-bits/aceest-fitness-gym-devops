## Local Setup & Execution

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pratima-yadav-bits/aceest-fitness-gym-devops.git
    cd aceest-fitness-gym-devops

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Flask application locally**
    ```bash
    python app.py

The API will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Docker Setup

1. **Build Docker image**
    ```bash
    docker build -t aceest-gym:latest .
2. **Run Docker container**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 aceest-gym:latest

Access the API at http://localhost:5000/

## Running Tests Manually
1. **Navigate to tests folder**
    ```bash
    cd tests
2. **Run Pytest**
    ```bash
    pytest test_app.py
This will execute all API endpoint tests and display results.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

### Jenkins
Jenkins server is configured to handle the primary build phase.
It pulls the latest code from GitHub and performs a clean build of the environment.
Serves as a secondary validation layer to ensure the code compiles and integrates correctly.

### GitHub Actions
Fully automated CI/CD pipeline configured via .github/workflows/main.yml.
Triggered on every push or pull request.
Stages executed:
1. **Build & Lint**: Check syntax and coding standards using pylint.
2. **Docker Image Assembly**: Build the Docker container for deployment.
3. **Automated Testing**: Run the Pytest suite inside the container to confirm functionality and stability.


| Endpoint          | Method | Description                            |
|-----------------  |--------|----------------------------------------|
| `/`               | GET    | Welcome message and available endpoints|
| `/programs`       | GET    | Returns all available programs         |
| `/program/<name>` | GET    | Returns details of a specific program  |
| `/clients`        | GET    | Returns all clients in the database    |
| `/add-client`     | POST   | Add a new client to the database       |
| `/bmi`            | GET    | Calculate BMI based on height & weight |

## VM Deployment Steps
The application is deployed on a virtual machine (VM) environment using Docker and Python.
1. The VM is accessed and the project directory is opened.
2. The system environment is verified, ensuring Python and pip are available.
3. Required dependencies such as Flask and other packages are installed.
4. The application is containerized and executed using Docker.
5. The running container is verified to ensure the application is active.
6. The application endpoints are tested using terminal-based requests.
7. All functionalities are validated within the VM environment.
8. Unit test cases are executed using Pytest to confirm application stability.
This process ensures that the application is successfully deployed and validated inside the VM.

## Notes
Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed for local execution.
Docker is required for containerized testing.
Jenkins and GitHub Actions pipelines provide automated validation, so manual build steps are optional once configured.
